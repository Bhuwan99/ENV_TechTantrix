Project for the problem statement - COVID-19 has led to an increase in medical waste as much of the personal protective equipment that healthcare professionals are using can only be worn once before being disposed of (eg. N-95 mask). Create a platform that has a checklist where you can select what type of medical waste you have,covers the safety procedures for handling medical waste, and a section where you can request a collection of waste from your house.
